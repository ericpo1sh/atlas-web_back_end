## What is a HATEOAS?

HATEOAS, or "Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State," is a concept in web development where along with receiving data, users also get links or buttons that guide them to what they can do next within an application or website. It's like getting clues on a treasure mapâ€”users are provided with clear pathways to navigate through the application, making it easier to interact with and understand the available functionalities without getting lost in the process.

## What is Pagination?

Pagination is a technique used in web development to manage large sets of data by breaking them into smaller, more manageable chunks or "pages." Instead of displaying all the data at once, pagination organizes it into separate pages, typically with a fixed number of items per page. Users can then navigate through the data by moving from one page to another using navigation controls like links or buttons. This approach improves the user experience by making content more accessible and easier to navigate, especially when dealing with extensive lists or search results.
